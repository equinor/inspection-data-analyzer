## Formatting

### CSharpier

In everyday development we use [CSharpier](https://csharpier.com/) to auto-format code on save. Installation procedure is described [here](https://csharpier.com/docs/About). No configuration should be required. To run csharpier locally, go to the backend folder and run:
`dotnet csharpier . --check`
